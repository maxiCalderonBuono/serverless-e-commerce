# serverless-e-commerce
This GitHub repository contains a project for creating an e-commerce platform using Google Sheets as the database for local sellers, with WhatsApp as the primary mode of communication between sellers and customers. This project aims to provide a simple and accessible solution for local sellers who want to sell their products online but may not have the technical expertise or resources to create a full-fledged e-commerce website. The use of Google Sheets as the database allows for easy management of products and inventory, while WhatsApp integration provides a convenient way for customers to place orders and communicate with sellers. The project is open-source, making it customizable and adaptable to different use cases and needs.
